# Egocentric-Action-Recognition
Deep learning project that aims at assessing the performance of applying the TA3N architecture into an Adapting Feature Norm (AFN) framework. Moreover, an ablation study on the components of TA3N is performed to understand the effectiveness of the domain alignment solutions adopted in this deep learning model. This project is the result of a  collaboration with https://github.com/Terdis and https://github.com/MatteoBerta.
